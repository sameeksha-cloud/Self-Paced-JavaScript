/* What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?



Lexical scope describes how nested (also known as "child") functions have access to variables defined in parent scopes.

const myFunction = () => {
     let myValue = 2;
     console.log(myValue);

     const childFunction = () => {
          console.log(myValue += 1);
     }

     childFunction();
}

myFunction();

explanation : childFunction has access to the variable myValue which is defined in the parent scope of myFunction.
The lexical scope of childFunction allows access to the parent scope.


closure: A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

const myFunction = () => {
     let myValue = 2;
     console.log(myValue);

     const childFunction = () => {
          console.log(myValue += 1);
     }

     return childFunction;
}

const result = myFunction();
console.log(result);
result();
result();
result();
result();



// myFunction returns childFunction instead of calling it.

// Therefore, when result is set equal to myFunction(), the console statement inside myFunction is logged, but not the statement inside childFunction.

// childFunction is not called into action.

// Instead, it is returned and held in result.

// In addition, we need to realize that myFunction has closed after it was called.

// The line with console.log(result) should show in the console that result now holds the anonymous function value that was childFunction.

// Now, when we call result(), we are calling the anonymous function that was assigned to childFunction.

// As a child of myFunction, this anonymous function has access to the myValue variable inside myFunction even after it has closed!

// The closure we created now allows us to continue to increase the value of the myValue variable every time we call result().
