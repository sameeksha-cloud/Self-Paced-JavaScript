// 3. Are function generators iterable in JavaScript?

// Ans - 
// Generators are functions that return iterables.
// Iterables are objects that have a method that is keyed by Symbol.iterator. 
// The existence of that method signals to various JavaScript constructs that an object is an iterable.
// They are both an iterable, and an iterator.
