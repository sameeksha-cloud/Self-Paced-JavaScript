/* 2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope ?

answer
-- Whenever you create a function within another function, then the inner function is closure. This closure is usually returned so you can use the outer function’s variables at a later time.
-- Whereas a scope in JavaScript defines what variables you have access to. There are two kinds of scope – global scope and local scope.
